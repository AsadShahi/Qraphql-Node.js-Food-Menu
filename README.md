Key Features:

GraphQL API to interact with the food menu, place orders, and fetch available food items.
Node.js backend to handle the server-side logic and data storage.
Menu management to add, update, and remove food items.
Order system to allow customers to place and track their food orders.
Simple authentication and authorization (optional based on implementation) to manage different roles (admin, user).
Main Goals:

Learn and implement GraphQL for building efficient APIs.
Provide a user-friendly way to explore the food menu and place orders.
Practice backend development using Node.js and GraphQL.
Feel free to contribute or use this as a starting point for your own projects!
